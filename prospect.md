This message is intended primarily for students who are applying to graduate 
school, or are starting graduate school, and are considering working in my 
research group. For students who are already here, you can sign up for an 
advanced course I am teaching, dropping by and talking with me, or sending 
me an e-mail to set up a visit. First, however, please read this message, 
especially before trying to plan a vist. <br><br>
<strong>Learn about what we do.</strong> If you believe that our research area 
might potentially be interesting to you, please look carefully at our papers/videos 
to learn about our research. In general, I am more likely to seriously engage a 
prospective student who has taken the time to get some idea of what our research 
involves, especially if they can explain why they would be well-suited to make 
contributions in our research group.<br><br>
<strong>No "openings" in the usual sense.</strong> Many students appear to be 
sending a form letter to a large number of faculty without mentionings of 
any research activities that are unique to any research group. Keep in mind that 
PhD level research are highly specialized; it is not just another programming 
job that any programmer can do. As a result, such messages are generally 
considered as negative and discarded. I usually do not offer funding directly to 
students before I have been able to get to know them well enough.<br><br>
<strong>My goals for students.</strong> I am very excited about the possibility 
of working with exceptional M.S./Ph.D. students. I intend to give strong 
personal guidance that will maximize their chances of building a rewarding and 
enjoyable career in research, even if they do not eventually pursue an academic 
career. Important goals that I have for students are: 1) the identification of 
fundamental research problems by developing a thorough understanding of current 
literature; 2) the development of a strong technical background that enables the 
proposal of independent and innovative solutions to challenging problems; 3) 
the presentation and publication of research in the most prestigious conferences
and journals; 4) the development of personal communication and presentation skills 
that are needed to maximize visibility in the research community. If you find 
the emphasis and our research topics appealing, I believe our group could provide 
you with a vibrant and exciting educational experience.<br><br> 
Good luck with your graduate studies!<br>
