## Prospective Students

We always look to working with motivated prospective students interested in fundamental and/or applied research in robotics. If you are interested in joining the ARC Lab, please read some of our recent papers and let Dr. Yu know **why** you find them interesting. Note that, given the volume of requests, generic inquries about "positions" at the lab will most likely not be answered.
