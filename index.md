      I'm a third-year doctoral student in Robotics at Rutgers, the State Univerisity of New Jersey, working with Professor Jingjin Yu. Currently, My research focuses on resolving combinatorial challenges in robot tasks and motion planning. Before arriving at Rutgers, I received a Bachelor's degree in Mathematics from the University of Science and Technology of China in 2019.
